## What is this?

`copilot-instructions.md` is GitHub's Copilot default instruction files, although alternatives behave the same. It's enough to have this placed on `<REPO_DIR>/.github/copilot-instructions.md` to have these rules picked up on every new agentic task or prompt.

Smart Contract Auditors are using agentic AI to uncover potential leads, learn the codebase faster, and even generate PoC's for exploits from time to time.

This is just a side tool though, and the human is what counts. This repo aims to empower the human-to-agent interactions, by incorporating auditing methodologies and way-of-thinking, so that when these agents are used they are supercharged with community insight focusing on providing more qualitative results.


## Why Share a Copilot Instructions?

- **Automatic Recognition**: No need to manually reference context files - the AI loads instructions automatically
- **Consistent Behavior**: Community-vetted principles and auditing guidelines across all conversations and sessions
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Focus on auditing instead of prompt engineering
- **Collaborative Improvement**: Centralized place for the community to enhance agentic AI auditing behaviors

## How to use

1. **Clone into your audit workspace:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/forefy/.context
   cp .context/copilot-instructions.md <your_repo>/.github/copilot-instructions.md
   ```

2. **Automatic Activation**: Modern AI assistants will automatically detect and load the `copilot-instructions.md` file

3. **Start Auditing**: The AI is now configured with:
   - Discovery and vulnerability analysis capabilities
   - Formal finding generation in standardized format
   - Impact assessment and fact-checking protocols
   - Unit test analysis for security insights
   - More
